# opentrons-scripts

This repository is a collection of scripts to control the opentrons robots belonging to the [FreeGenes project](https://biobricks.org/freegenes/). The scripts' specific functions vary, but the bulk of the code is used for automated cell cloning.

Currently, all scripts are written in python, using the opentrons python API version 2 ([Documentation](https://docs.opentrons.com/v2/index.html))

Prior to January 2020, scripts were written using API version 1. Documentation for that API can be found [here](https://docs.opentrons.com/v1/api.html).
