# opentrons-scripts

This repository is a collection of scripts to control the opentrons robots belonging to the [FreeGenes project](https://biobricks.org/freegenes/). The scripts' specific functions vary, but the bulk of the code is used for automated cell cloning.

Currently, all scripts are written in python, using the opentrons python API. Documentation for that API can be found [here](https://docs.opentrons.com/v1/api.html).
